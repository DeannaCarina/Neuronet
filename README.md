## Introduction

Neuronet is a way to bring neurodiverse individuals into the light. It is a way for businesses to fill posts from a talent pool that may otherwise go unnoticed or disregarded. Most people are neurotypical, meaning that the brain functions and processes information in the way society expects. However it is estimated that around 1 in 7 people (more than 15% of people in the UK) are neurodivergent, meaning that the brain functions, learns and processes information differently. Highly-focused concentration, careful attention to detail and out of the box thinking are some of the skills often associated with autism, and as such it would be a huge loss to have these incredible individuals go underappreciated. Neuronet seeks to connect employers with these applicants in a way that is both comfortable and empathetic to the needs of those who may not be able to connect in the more conventional ways.

## UX
### Strategy
#### Vision
Neuronet is a specialised multifunctional application catering to the needs of neurodiverse individuals, as well as give the opportunity to companies to employ individuals from an under-represented talent pool. It will give neurodiverse individuals the opporunity to showcase their talents, strengths and weaknesses in a non-judgmental environment, by allowing them to complete an online resume and disclose the unique skillsets they have, as well as diclose the environments and situations that will allow them to communicate and work to the best of their abilities. The website will be highly accessible and take into consideration the requirement for an environment that meets the needs of these individuals through the use of colour schemes, high levels of user intuitiveness and giving the choice of varying means of communication with potential employers. It will allow companies to advertise current open roles via a job board, and arrange the interview process for applicants. The companies will be able to disclose the types of interviews that would be available such as video-call, e-mail, phone-call or face-to-face with stipulations such as only 1 or 2 interviewers or the interviewee may bring a friend or family member with them as support. Our overall vision is to have neurodiverse individuals to not be at a disadvantage because of their unique needs. 

#### Aims
<ol>
    <li>To be a safe non-judgemental environment for neurodiverse individuals to showcase their talents</li>
    <li>To be a highly user intuitive application for users with neurodiverse tendancies</li>
    <li>To be an environment where companies can advertise their open job roles on a job-board to be inclusive of individuals who are neurodiverse</li>
    <li>To be a web application for companies and prospective applicants to use during the job application process where application/interview and work environments can be discussed in advance to suit the needs of the neurodiverse individual</li>
    <li>To be highly accessible in terms of colour scheme and contrast to cater for the needs of those with sensory needs</li>
    <li>To be a learning tool for companies to ensure they are using best practices to ensure they are catering for the needs of neurodiverse individuals</li>
    <li>To enable individuals with conditions such as social anxiety to be more comfortable in highly stressful situations which occur in the job application and interview processes</li>
</ol>

#### Target Audience
We have two main target audiences:
<ul>
    <li>Individuals who are neurodiverse to include those with conditions such as: Autism, anxiety, depression, bipolar, BDD, OCD, phobias, dyslexia, tourettes and many many more.</li>
    <li>Companies that want to improve their employee diversity by including individuals that have unique skills that arise from conditions mentioned above. </li>
</ul>
The application could also be aimed at recruiters that are more aware of the need to have neurodiverse individuals 'in the workplace'.

#### User Stories

As we can see from the table above, the viability is higher than the importance, which is good because that means most of the features are able to be implemented, however we must be careful not to implemnt features that would be unneccessary for the web application and decrease the usability of the site from a Neurodiverse peron's perspective. We must also be careful to stay within the scope of our own coding limitations - implementing features that we have little experience of could cause a high liklihood of bugs and errors in the web application which would in turn reduce the potential of a positive user experience.
The table above has been plotted into a graph (below) to easily visualise the features that will be implemented into the web application and which ones won't be:
<ul>
    <li>The features in the pink section will be implemented</li>
    <li>The features in the grey section could be implemented at a later date but aren't necessary right now</li>
    <li>The features in the turquoise section will not be implemented as it would be unwise to focus on these features until a later date</li>
</ul>

### Scope
Due to the pitfalls of developing a website based on the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) model such as lack of user experience and enjoyment due to a lack of content, it is sometimes more beneficial to develop a website based on MMP (Minimum Marketable Product). However due to the sprint nature and the time constraints we have for this project (a total of 4 full days from brief to presentation) we have to create the website based on MVP. This will allow the basic functions of the website to be implemented and have the website be usable but not neccessarily complete with all of the discussed features in place. One of the main advantages of creating an MVP is we can gauge the reaction of users before implementing more features, to ensure that the overall necessity for the web application is there, meaning less time is potentially wasted on a product that isn't going to be used by our target audience.  

By using the MVP model we will:
<ul>
    <li>Create a clear website with enough content for the users to establish the usefulness of the web application</li>
    <li>Result in a website with medium levels of UX, but still enough to be user friendly for our target audiences</li>
    <li>Meet the needs of the business and user on the most basic levels</li>
</ul>
While following the MVP model, to meet the user and business goals, our website will include:
<ul>
    <li>A self-designed logo on all pages as assurance to the customer we are a trusted-business with our own identity</li>
    <li>A nav-bar on all pages to be able to navigate to separate pages on the website</li>
    <li>Links to associalted social media on all pages within the footer</li>
    <li>sign up forms for users to be able to create personal profiles</li>
    <li>Form for prospective employees to fill in as an alternative to a CV to show their talents and skills</li>
    <li>A job board for prospective employers to post to, to be able to advertise current open roles in their business</li>
</ul>
