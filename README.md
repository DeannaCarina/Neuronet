## Introduction

Neuronet is a way to bring neurodiverse individuals into the light. It is a way for businesses to fill posts from a talent pool that may otherwise go unnoticed or disregarded. Most people are neurotypical, meaning that the brain functions and processes information in the way society expects. However it is estimated that around 1 in 7 people (more than 15% of people in the UK) are neurodivergent, meaning that the brain functions, learns and processes information differently. Highly-focused concentration, careful attention to detail and out of the box thinking are some of the skills often associated with autism, and as such it would be a huge loss to have these incredible individuals go underappreciated. Neuronet seeks to connect employers with these applicants in a way that is both comfortable and empathetic to the needs of those who may not be able to connect in the more conventional ways.
