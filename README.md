## Introduction

Neuronet is a way to bring neurodiverse individuals into the light. It is a way for businesses to fill posts from a talent pool that may otherwise go unnoticed or disregarded. Most people are neurotypical, meaning that the brain functions and processes information in the way society expects. However it is estimated that around 1 in 7 people (more than 15% of people in the UK) are neurodivergent, meaning that the brain functions, learns and processes information differently. Highly-focused concentration, careful attention to detail and out of the box thinking are some of the skills often associated with autism, and as such it would be a huge loss to have these incredible individuals go underappreciated. Neuronet seeks to connect employers with these applicants in a way that is both comfortable and empathetic to the needs of those who may not be able to connect in the more conventional ways.

## UX
### Strategy
#### Vision
Neuronet is a specialised multifunctional application catering to the needs of neurodiverse individuals, as well as give the opportunity to companies to employ individuals from an under-represented talent pool. It will give neurodiverse individuals the opporunity to showcase their talents, strengths and weaknesses in a non-judgmental environment, by allowing them to complete an online resume and disclose the unique skillsets they have, as well as diclose the environments and situations that will allow them to communicate and work to the best of their abilities. The website will be highly accessible and take into consideration the requirement for an environment that meets the needs of these individuals through the use of colour schemes, high levels of user intuitiveness and giving the choice of varying means of communication with potential employers. It will allow companies to advertise current open roles via a job board, and arrange the interview process for applicants. The companies will be able to disclose the types of interviews that would be available such as video-call, e-mail, phone-call or face-to-face with stipulations such as only 1 or 2 interviewers or the interviewee may bring a friend or family member with them as support. Our overall vision is to have neurodiverse individuals to not be at a disadvantage because of their unique needs. 

#### Aims
<ol>
    <li>To be a safe non-judgemental environment for neurodiverse individuals to showcase their talents</li>
    <li>To be a highly user intuitive application for users with neurodiverse tendancies</li>
    <li>To be an environment where companies can advertise their open job roles on a job-board to be inclusive of individuals who are neurodiverse</li>
    <li>To be a web application for companies and prospective applicants to use during the job application process where application/interview and work environments can be discussed in advance to suit the needs of the neurodiverse individual</li>
    <li>To be highly accessible in terms of colour scheme and contrast to cater for the needs of those with sensory needs</li>
    <li>To be a learning tool for companies to ensure they are using best practices to ensure they are catering for the needs of neurodiverse individuals</li>
    <li>To enable individuals with conditions such as social anxiety to be more comfortable in highly stressful situations which occur in the job application and interview processes</li>
</ol>

#### Target Audience
We have two main target audiences:
<ul>
    <li>Individuals who are neurodiverse to include those with conditions such as: Autism, anxiety, depression, bipolar, BDD, OCD, phobias, dyslexia, tourettes and many many more.</li>
    <li>Companies that want to improve their employee diversity by including individuals that have unique skills that arise from conditions mentioned above. </li>
</ul>
The application could also be aimed at recruiters that are more aware of the need to have neurodiverse individuals 'in the workplace'.

#### User Stories

</table>
As we can see from the table above, the viability is higher than the importance, which is good because that means most of the features are able to be implemented, however we must be careful not to implemnt features that would be unneccessary for the web application and decrease the usability of the site from a Neurodiverse peron's perspective. We must also be careful to stay within the scope of our own coding limitations - implementing features that we have little experience of could cause a high liklihood of bugs and errors in the web application which would in turn reduce the potential of a positive user experience.
The table above has been plotted into a graph (below) to easily visualise the features that will be implemented into the web application and which ones won't be:
<ul>
    <li>The features in the pink section will be implemented</li>
    <li>The features in the grey section could be implemented at a later date but aren't necessary right now</li>
    <li>The features in the turquoise section will not be implemented as it would be unwise to focus on these features until a later date</li>
</ul>

### Scope
Due to the pitfalls of developing a website based on the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) model such as lack of user experience and enjoyment due to a lack of content, it is sometimes more beneficial to develop a website based on MMP (Minimum Marketable Product). However due to the sprint nature and the time constraints we have for this project (a total of 4 full days from brief to presentation) we have to create the website based on MVP. This will allow the basic functions of the website to be implemented and have the website be usable but not neccessarily complete with all of the discussed features in place. One of the main advantages of creating an MVP is we can gauge the reaction of users before implementing more features, to ensure that the overall necessity for the web application is there, meaning less time is potentially wasted on a product that isn't going to be used by our target audience.  

By using the MVP model we will:
<ul>
    <li>Create a clear website with enough content for the users to establish the usefulness of the web application</li>
    <li>Result in a website with medium levels of UX, but still enough to be user friendly for our target audiences</li>
    <li>Meet the needs of the business and user on the most basic levels</li>
</ul>
While following the MVP model, to meet the user and business goals, our website will include:
<ul>
    <li>A self-designed logo on all pages as assurance to the customer we are a trusted-business with our own identity</li>
    <li>A nav-bar on all pages to be able to navigate to separate pages on the website</li>
    <li>Links to associalted social media on all pages within the footer</li>
    <li>sign up forms for users to be able to create personal profiles</li>
    <li>Form for prospective employees to fill in as an alternative to a CV to show their talents and skills</li>
    <li>A job board for prospective employers to post to, to be able to advertise current open roles in their business</li>
</ul>

### Structure
**PROVISIONAL**
We have chosen to carry out a non-linear method of design for this website application as it consists of multiple pages which might not necessarily be viewed in a particular order as each page has a different role to play. By having multiple pages we can separate information into logical sections to make it easier for the user to find what they are looking for particularly for the users that may find it more difficult to navigate websites. The navigation bar at the top of all of the pages allows the user to easily navigate to the page of the website they are most interested in. There are also certain pages (such as on the jobs board) that have their own internal navigation sections as each advertised job will take the user to the full job advertisement when they interact with the 'job card'.
<br><br>
<strong>On index.html</strong>: Separate sign in/sign up buttons for business owners and prospective employees? Each button brings up separate modal? If user doesn't have an account - link in modal to take to specific sign up page?<br><br>
<strong>On signupbusiness.html</strong>: Form to fill in to choose username, email, password <br><br>
<strong>On signupuser.html</strong>: Form to fill in to choose username, email, password <br><br>
<strong>On profile.html</strong>: Form to fill in for user to state details (name, DOB, address etc etc), qualifications, talents, strengths, weaknesses, talk about themselves etc.<br><br>
<strong>On company.html</strong>: Form to fill in for business to fill in business name, values, location etc etc. and a separate form to fill for advertising job posts - job title, job role, person spec, location etc.<br><br>
<strong>On board.html</strong>: Page of jobs advertised by companies which are linked to the full job advert<br><br>
<strong>On jobadvert.html</strong>: Full job advert including job title, job role, person spec, location etc. (everything the business owner inputted into the form in their profile page)<br><br>
<strong>On contactus.html</strong>: Form to fill in to contact Neuronet for any user problems and tech support<br><br>
<strong>On 404.html</strong>: Neuronet logo, appologies, redirect to index.html link<br>

### Skeleton
The wireframes for the <em>Neuronet</em> website application were made with Canva and Balsamiq, they can be found by viewing the images below. As the trend for mobile browser usage has been on an upwards trend for the last 10 years in Europe culminating in a crossover of hardware usage in the recent year, it could be assumed that these trends will continue and result in users opting more and more for a mobile browser instead of a desktop.<br>
<img src="media/stats1.png" width="70%"><br>
Due to this assumed continuing trend we have chosen to take a mobile-first approch to the design process. A Mobile-First Approach refers to the practice of designing and/or developing an online experience for mobile before designing for desktop web or any other device. Taking a Mobile First approach aims to reverse the workflow of designing for desktop and scaling down the design for mobile afterwards. Wireframes were made for mobile and desktop devices to ensure user friendly UX was employed throughout.

<img src="media/wire4.png" width="30%">
<img src="media/wire5.png" width="30%">
<img src="media/wire6.png" width="30%">

The wireframes were created during the website application's initial desgin process, as such there are changes between the layout of the wireframes and the final layout/design of the finished website. 

### Surface
#### Typography
As recommended in various literature, we have chosen to use sans-serif fonts throughout the website as these are more user friendly for users with specialised sensory needs. We used <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a> to find the typography that we wanted to use for the website. 
<br>

**PROVISIONAL** 
The fonts we used for the text body of the website was 'Lato' as this font is easy to read which is needed when there is large amounts of information to be read and absorbed by users, it has a modern feel, and is a popular font for many websites. The back-up font is 'Sans-Serif' just in case the font import link fails. The font used for headings is 'Roboto' this is also a very popular font recommended by many websites that cater to the needs of individuals with neurodivesity.

#### Colour Scheme
We have tried to make the colour scheme as user friendly as possible to cater to the needs of individuals with possible sensory overload disorders such as autism. After carrying out some research it was found that toned down blues and greens were the most favourable for these types of individuals, as well as neutral colours such as greys and beiges. 

#### Icons
The <em>Neuronet</em> logo was handmade by the team "Accessibility All-Stars" during the website development process. We felt this was a very important aspect to get done quickly as this would give us a feel for how the website would take shape. The logo itself is based on the neurodiversity logo which is a rainbow coloured infinity symbol, the neural pathways within the loop were added to symbolise the "Neuro" and to a point also "net" of the Neuronet brand name as this gives the users an inclination as to the purpose of the website. The brand name and tag line underneath the sympol were added to the symbol to again help the user identify the purpose of the website and to encourage inclusion by acknowledging everybody's ability to think differently and that this is a huge benefit to workplaces that are striving to be more diverse.

### DEFINITION:
Neurodiversity is defined by Dictionary.com as, “the variation and differences in neurological structure and function that exist among human beings, especially when viewed as being normal and natural rather than pathological.”
To take it a step further, the Autistic Self Advocacy Network states, “Neurodiversity refers to variation in neurocognitive functioning. It is an umbrella term that encompasses neurocognitive differences such as autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), dyslexia, Tourette’s syndrome, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, intellectual disability and schizophrenia, as well as ‘normal’ neurocognitive functioning, or neurotypicality. Neurodivergent individuals are those whose brain functions differ from those who are neurologically typical, or neurotypical.”

### FACTS:
The neurodiverse population remains a largely untapped talent pool. Unemployment runs as high as 80% (this figure includes people with more-severe disorders, who are not candidates for neurodiversity programs). When they are working, even highly capable neurodiverse people are often underemployed.
Finding and keeping top talent is an ongoing challenge for employers, especially in high-tech sectors. The Harvard Business Review reported in 2017 that the European Union (EU) was facing an impending shortage of 800,000 information technology (IT) workers, many in strategically important and rapidly expanding areas. Increasing demand for candidates to fill jobs in specialized fields like information technology, banking and financial services, and healthcare is producing talent shortages. More and more, employers are turning to previously unexplored talent pools to help meet staffing needs. A growing number of companies have created programs specifically focused on recruiting and hiring neurodivergent people, including those on the autism spectrum.

A growing number of prominent companies have reformed their HR processes in order to access neurodiverse talent; among them are SAP, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Microsoft, Willis Towers Watson, Ford, and EY. Many others, including Caterpillar, Dell Technologies, Deloitte, IBM, JPMorgan Chase, and UBS, have start-up or exploratory efforts under way.

### BENEFITS FOR THE BUSINESS:
Employers who hire neurodiverse employees note their aptitude for roles that require attention to detail, ability to detect patterns and capacity for inferential reasoning, as well as strong skills in mathematics, coding and other data-driven processes. Neurodiverse employees are also often lauded for exhibiting loyalty and timeliness, and for offering innovative, creative perspectives to improve policies and procedures that can increase a company’s bottom line. Employers consistently report that their neurodiverse teams prove more effective and productive than those without neurodiverse representation.
Other capabilities that people with neurocognitive disabilities possess that benefit employers include:
<ul>
    <li>Keen accuracy and ability to detect errors</li>
    <li>High levels of concentration</li>
    <li>Strong recall and detailed factual knowledge</li>
    <li>Reliability and persistence</li>
    <li>Technical strengths</li>
    <li>Appreciation for routine/repetition</li>
</ul>

While neurodiversity hiring programs are often known to seek out employees that prefer technological duties such as software engineering or tech operations, or repetitive tasks, such as data-entry or filing, there are a wide variety of jobs and responsibilities that neurodiverse employees can perform. These include (but are certainly not limited to) product management, human resources, banking and customer service.

In addition, research has shown that consumers prefer doing business with companies that employ people with disabilities. Given the high percentage of neurodivergence within the average customer base, having people on staff that represent the communities a company serves demonstrates thoughtfulness and good customer service.

Neurodiverse people frequently need workplace accommodations, such as headphones to prevent auditory overstimulation, to activate or maximally leverage their abilities. Sometimes they exhibit challenging eccentricities. In many cases the accommodations and challenges are manageable and the potential returns are great. But to realize the benefits, most companies would have to adjust their recruitment, selection, and career development policies to reflect a broader definition of talent.

### BENEFITS FOR THE EMPLOYEE:
Neurodiverse hiring also offers benefits to other employees. Many people with neurocognitive disabilities, specifically those with autism, share experiences of discrimination and stigma, both in hiring processes and work settings, based on their perceived traits. However, many organizations find that having neurodiverse employees improves overall employee morale and positively affects organizational culture.
Often, neurotypical employees appreciate being educated about neurodiversity and say they tend to experience a greater sense of company pride when part of an inclusive workplace. Moreover, when neurodiverse employees are given job responsibilities that align with their skills and abilities, they—like most neurotypical employees—often report greater confidence and self-esteem. Finally, neurodiverse employees frequently express greater comfort with interpersonal interactions when employers consider workplace environmental factors and make appropriate accommodations for their needs, such as providing social skills, teamwork and office behaviour training.

### WHY IS THE WEB APPLICATION NEEDED?
Being neurodivergent will usually amount to a disability under the Equality Act 2010. This means the organisation has a legal obligation to make reasonable adjustments to the workplace and the individual's role that will remove or minimise any disadvantage to them.

Having a workplace that is set up to proactively think about what can be done to support the needs of each employee can make it much easier to identify and implement adjustments for neurodivergent staff.

Remember, a person is disabled if they have 'a physical or mental impairment' which has 'a substantial and long-term adverse effect' on their 'ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities'. Therefore, someone may not have been diagnosed with a neurodivergence but still be considered to have a disability under the Equality Act 2010.

Neurodiversity is an aspect of diversity that enhances the workplace in numerous ways. People with neurocognitive disabilities have talents, perspectives and skills that can be distinctly beneficial in many work environments. More and more employers are beginning to understand these benefits and develop hiring initiatives that focus on recruiting neurodiverse workers. While these efforts are more common in larger corporations, they have proven beneficial for businesses of all sizes in a variety of industries. Hiring neurodiverse employees can provide companies with a competitive edge that brings measurable benefits, both financially and in terms of workplace culture.

Askearn’s Neurodiversity in the workplace inclusion checklist states that it is fundamental for employers to create applicant referral, inclusive interview and screening processes by:
<ul>
    <li>Consider developing an alternative interview process for neurodivergent applicants</li>
    <li>Design a process to assess applicant skills to match these skills with required tasks</li>
    <li>Identify a local/regional service provider(s) who can assist with identifying applicants</li>
</ul>
